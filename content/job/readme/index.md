I've been working two month in 2018 as a part-time react developer for [Readme](https://readme.com/)
The work was remote on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~013620cf796bcd85ee)

It was open source project, so you can see my work on [Github](https://github.com/readmeio/api-explorer/commits?author=nadalfederer)

What have I done:
*   I converted few swagger's specification to UI view(react).
*   Improved test coverage


Technologies:
*   Frontend stack: react, redux, thunk
*   Swagger
